1. How to Install DJANGO web framework on Centos 7:
    1a. Install EPEL Repository --> contains extra packages as part of the core distribution.
        1a1. sudo yum install epel-release

2. Install django through pip in a Virtualenv --> The Python "virtualenv" package allows you to create self-contained environments for various projects.  Using this, you can install Django in a project directory without affecting the greater system.  This allows you to provide per-project customizations and packages easily.  
    2a. Install Django through pip in a Virtualenv
        2a1. Install pip from the EPEL repository
            2a1a. sudo yum install python-pip
    2b. Once pip installed, install virtualenv through pip
        2b1. sudo pip install virtualenv

3. Now, when you start a new project, you can create a new virtual environment
for it.  Start by creating a directory for it and then cd in to it.
    3a. mkdir ~/newproject, cd ~/newproject

4. Create a virtual environment within the project directory
    4a. virtualenv [environment_name]

5. To install packages in to the newly created isolated environment, it
    must first be activated:
    5a. source [virtual_environment_name]/bin/activate --> from within the
        directory where the virtual environment was created.

6. In new environment, use pip to install Django.  Note: you do not need to use sudo since you are installing locally within virtual environment.
    6a. pip install django (to install latest version, or you can specify
        a specific version)
    6b. Verify Django version and successful install:
        6b1. django-admin --version
    6c. To leave virtual environment:
        6c1. deactivate
